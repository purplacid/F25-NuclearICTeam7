    #tip for batch and workers selection: 
    #open task manager to check GPU usage after starting training. If GPU usage hovers around 80-100% most of time, then this is a sweet spot.
    #if GPU usage is lower than this, try increasing workers
    #if memory usage is low, try increasing batch number
